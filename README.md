# Firely
***
Firely is aiming to help users to detect the closest naturally occurring wild fires along with man made fires 
occuring.
Upon the user input, it will detect and plot the closest fire location to the user on the map and will display the distance 
between the user and the occurring fire in metric units.
The address search can be made internationally.
